I work as platform engineer for sciebo, which is a sync and share solution for
public institues of higher education in the state of North Rhine Westphalia,
Germany.

As part of this I am glad to be part of the very excellent
[CS3 Community](https://www.cs3community.org/), where providers, developers
and users of **c**loud **s**torage and **s**ync and **s**hare systems gather.

My bubble here consists of people running a stack of ownCloud/Nextcloud with
some collaborative software like OnlyOffice/Collabora at state or national
scale.

### Blog

I run [a blog](https://deaddy.net/).

I have a small series on [Kubernetes](https://deaddy.net/tag/kubernetes.html),
which is a bit more high level than most introductions and gives you an
overview over what kubernetes itself does and the components you might need to
integrate into your cluster to get it production grade.
